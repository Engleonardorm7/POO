# Exercise 2 using derived classes, inheritance and polymorphism

object oriented programming projects

>Consider the following inheritance relationship, which involves three classes: Student, Athlete, and ScholarSport. The latter represents those students who are athletes and for that reason have received a special scholarship from the government to reward their efforts. Decide what attributes and methods to include so your program can:

>1) declare two objects named studentJuan and studentPedro of type Student

>2) declare an object called sportLuis of type Athlete

>3) declare two objects called bdAna and bdCarmen of type ScholarSport

>4) print the data of all declared objects

>5) update the name of the career that the studentJuan and bdAna are studying. The data given by the user will be the name of the new career 

>6) Update the name of the coach sportLuis and bdCarmen. The data given by the user will be the name of the new coach

>7) Update the amount of the bdAna and bdCarmen scholarship. The data given by the user will be the percentage increase of the current scholarship
